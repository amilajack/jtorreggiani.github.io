          I'm a human on a mission to do the most good I can do.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over 9 years ago, as an undergraduate majoring in history, I was inspired by the struggles and triumphs of the human species. Dismayed by the suffering and environmental degradation I was seeing in the world, I became dedicated to making a positive difference in any way I could.
        </p>

        <p>
          I realised that science presented potential solutions to many of the challenges facing society. After graduating in 2010, I began a period of intensive self-directed learning and further education in STEM. I developed an affinity for computing and have been building a successful career in the software industry ever since.

        <p>
          Today, I am a senior software engineer at Agrilyst Inc, which provides a platform that helps indoor farmers manage their crops and make data-driven decisions to improve production efficiency and profitability.
